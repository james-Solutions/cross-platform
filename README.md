# Cross Platform

This project is designed to be a testing ground to develop a true cross platform project. The goal will be to develop a
application that looks and functions the same across numerous platforms with little re-used code. Meaning, in an ideal
world, one code base and its type, would produce an application that will work on Desktop (Microsoft, Linux, macOS), Web
Browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, IE), and on Mobile Devices (Tablets, Smart phones).

The intent will be to use React as the base, wrapping it with Electron for the Desktop application, and a React Native
application for mobile devices. Along with shared code between these distinct areas of the application.
